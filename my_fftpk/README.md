The purpose of this set of routines is to develop an FFT Poisson solver capable of handling mixed inhomogeneous boundary conditions.

The routines follow the paper by Schumann and Sweet (JCP, 1988).

The main routine is `fft_poisson_solver.m`.  Various 1D problems can be tested by altering the parameters in the "driver" routines.
